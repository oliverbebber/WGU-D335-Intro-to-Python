# Lesson 04 Branching Notes

These are my notes for Lesson 04 of the Intro to Python course.

## Sections

### 1. If-else branches (general)

- **Branch**: part of a program that executes only if a certain condition is met.  
- **if branch**: a branch that runs **only** when a specific condition evaluates to ```True```.
  - Remember to use a colon after the ```if``` statement
  - Example
  > ```python
  > if age > 21:
  >   print("Drinks can be served")
  > ```
- **if-else branch**: a decision structure with **two** branches.
  - The ```if``` branch runs if the condition is ```True```.
  - The ```else``` branch runs if the condition is ```False```.
  - Example
  > ```python
  > if age > 21:
  >   print("Drinks can be served")
  > else:
  >   print("Sorry, you are not old enough to drink")
  > ```
