# write a program that reads a loan amount, payment amount, and interest rate as inputs
loan_amount = float(input())  # aka current balance
payment_amount = float(input())
interest_rate = float(input())

# initialize a counter to track how many payments are made
# initialize the current balance on the loan

# loop until balance is less than or equal to zero:
  # first, apply interest to the current balance
  # then, subtract the payment amount from the balance
  # increase the payment counter by 1 (+= 1)

# after loop ends, output the number of payments remaining
# be sure output language aligns for singular or plural
