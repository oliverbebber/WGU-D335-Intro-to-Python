# Lesson 05 Loops Notes

These are my notes for Lesson 05 of the Intro to Python course.

## Sections

### 1. Loops

- **Loop**: a program construct that performs the same check, or action, while the expression is true; once the expression is false, the loop ends.
  - Example
  > ``` python
  > count = 1
  > while count <= 3:  # Loop runs while the condition is true
  >     print("Hello") # Loop body
  >     count += 1
  > ```
 
- **iteration**: one complete execution of the loop body.
  - Example
    - Using the same loop above:
      - 1st iteration: count = 1, prints "Hello", increments to 2
      - 2nd iteration: count = 2, prints "Hello", increments to 3
      - 3rd iteration: count = 3, prints "Hello", increments to 4 --> condition is now false, loop stops

### 2. While loops


### 3. More while examples


### 4. Counting


### 5. For loops


### 6. Counting using the range() function


### 7. While vs. for loops


### 8. Nested loops


### 9. Developing programs incrementally


### 10. Break and continue


### 11. Getting both index and value when looping: enumerate()
