# Lesson 05 Loops Notes

These are my notes for Lesson 05 of the Intro to Python course.

## Sections

### 1. Loops

- **Loop**: a program construct that performs the same check, or action, while the expression is true; once the expression is false, the loop ends.
  - Example
  > ``` python
  > count = 1
  > while count <= 3:  # Loop runs while the condition is true
  >     print("Hello") # Loop body
  >     count += 1
  > ```
 
- **iteration**: one complete execution of the loop body.
  - Example
    - Using the same loop above:
      - 1st iteration: count = 1, prints "Hello", increments to 2
      - 2nd iteration: count = 2, prints "Hello", increments to 3
      - 3rd iteration: count = 3, prints "Hello", increments to 4 --> condition is now false, loop stops

### 2. While loops

- **while loop**: repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a given condition evalues to ```True```
  - Example
  > ``` python
  > while condition:
  >   # loop body
  > ```
  
- **loop body**: the indented block if code that runs each time the loop condition is checked and determined to be ```True```
  - Example
  > ``` python
  > count = 0
  > while count < 3:
  >   print("Hello!")  # loop body
  >   count += 1
  > ```
  
- **sentinel value**: a special value used to signal the end of input, or to stop a loop.
  - Example
  > ``` python
  > sentinel = -1
  > num = int(input('Enter a number (-1 to quit): '))
  > while num != sentinel:
  >     print(num)
  >     num = int(input('Enter a number (-1 to quit): '))
  > print('goodbye!')
  > ```
  
- **infinite loop**: a loop that never ends because its conditional always evaluates as ```True``` (or there isn't a condition to stop the loop).

### 3. More while examples

- **docstring**: a special type of string used to document Python functions, classes, or modules; written inside triple quotes (```''' '''```) at the beginning of the function/class/module.

- **randint() function**: part of Python's ```random``` module; returns a random integer within a specified range (inclusive)
  - Example
  > ``` python
  > import random
  >
  > # generate a random number between 1 and 37
  > num = random.randint(1, 37)
  > print(num)
  > ```  

### 4. Counting

- **loop variable**: keeps track of each repetition of a loop; usually changes value each time the loop runs and helps control how many times it is executed.
  - Example
  > ``` python
  > # Iterating N times using a loop variable
  > i = 1
  > while i <= N:
  >   # Loop body statesments go here
  >   i = i + 1
  > ```

ðŸ“Œ Note: it's a common error to forget to include a loop variable update at the end of a loop which causes an *unintended* infinite loop.

**Other forms of counting**

- While loop with loop variable that counts down: 

  > ``` python
  > i = 5
  > while i >= 1:
  >   i = i - 1  # loop body will execute when i = 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 but does NOT execute when it reaches 0
  > ```
  
- Loop variable increased by 2 per iteration

  > ``` python
  > i = 0
  > while i <= 100:
  >   i = i + 2
  > ```

**Shorthand operators**

| Operator | Meaning                         | Example           | Equivalent To       |
|----------|---------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| +=       | Add and assign                  | x += 5            | x = x + 5           |
| -=       | Subtract and assign             | x -= 3            | x = x - 3           |
| *=       | Multiply and assign             | x *= 2            | x = x * 2           |
| /=       | Divide and assign (float)       | x /= 4            | x = x / 4           |
| //=      | Floor divide and assign         | x //= 4           | x = x // 4          |
| %=       | Modulo and assign               | x %= 2            | x = x % 2           |
| **=      | Exponent and assign             | x **= 3           | x = x ** 3          |


### 5. For loops

- **for loop**: each item in a sequence is processed in order. The loop will temporarily assign each item to a variable, which is then available for use within the loop body
  - Example
  > ``` python
  > numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]
  > 
  > for num in numbers:  # num is the variable, numbers is the container
  >   # Loop body: goes through each item in numbers
  >   print(f'The square of {num} is {num ** 2}'}
  >
  > # Statements to execute after the for loop is complete
  > print('Done looping!')
  > ```


### 6. Counting using the range() function

- **range() function**: allows counting in *for* loops; creates a sequence of integers between a starting integer that's included within the range, an ending integer that isn't included in the range, and an integer step value. 

| Range            | Generated sequence | Explanation                   |
|------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| `range(5)`       | 0 1 2 3 4          | Every integer from 0 to 4     |
| `range(0, 5)`    | 0 1 2 3 4          | Every integer from 0 to 4     |
| `range(3, 7)`    | 3 4 5 6            | Every integer from 3 to 6     |
| `range(10, 13)`  | 10 11 12           | Every integer from 10 to 12   |
| `range(0, 5, 1)` | 0 1 2 3 4          | Every 1 integer from 0 to 4   |
| `range(0, 5, 2)` | 0 2 4              | Every 2nd integer from 0 to 4 |
| `range(5, 0, -1)`| 5 4 3 2 1          | Every 1 integer from 5 to 1   |
| `range(5, 0, -2)`| 5 3 1              | Every 2nd integer from 5 to 1 |
