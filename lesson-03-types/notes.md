# Lesson 03 Types Notes

These are my notes for Lesson 03 of the Intro to Python course.

## Sections

### 1. Introduction


### 2. String basics

- **String**: a sequence of characters used to represent text (names, sentences, labels, etc.); can be created from user input or written directly into the program.
  - Strings **can** include numbers, letters, symbols, and spaces.
- **String literal**: text that is **hard-coded** into the program using quotes (single or double)
  - Example
  > ```'Mary'```, ```"Hello!"```
  
- **Sequence type**: a string that stores a collection of items in a specific order: from first to last.
  - Each character has a **position** (called an **index**).
  - You can **access, slice, and iterate** over the characters using that order.
