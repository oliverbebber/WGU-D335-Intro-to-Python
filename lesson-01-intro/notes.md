# Lesson 01 Intro Notes

These are my notes for Lesson 01 of the Intro to Python course.

## Overview

Introduction to programming concepts and Python basics. This lesson covers general programming ideas, Python-specific syntax, and development tools.

## Sections

### 1. Programming (General)

- **Program**: a set of instructions that execute one at a time.
- **Input**: data a program receives, whether from a file, peripheral (keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, etc.), network, or other sources.
  - Example
  ```python
  # Get user input
  name = input("Enter your name: ")
  ```

- **Process**: actions performed on the input, like adding or subtractiong two values.
- **Output**: data a program provides after processing input. Output can be to a file, displayed on a screen, or sent over a network.
  - Example
  ```python
  # Print a greeting
  print("Hello, " + name + "!")
  ```

- **Variables**: a named placeholder that stores data a program can use and modify.
    - Example
      ```python
      # Assign a value to a variable
      age = 25
      name = Oliver

      # Display variables
      print("Name:", name)
      print("Age:", age)
      ```
      
- **Computational thinking**: the process of creating clear, step-by-step instructions to solve a problem.
- **Algorithm**: a logical, ordered sequence of instructions used to solve a problem.
