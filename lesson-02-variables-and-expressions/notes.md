# Lesson 02 Variables and Expressions Notes

These are my notes for Lesson 02 of the Intro to Python course.

## Sections

### 1. Variables and Expressions

- **Variable**: a named placeholder that stores data a program can use and modify.
  - Examples
    ```python
    x = 3
    num_cats = 7
    ```

- **Assignment statement**: stores a value in a variable by using the ```=``` symbol.
  - Python evaluates the **expression on the right** and stores the result in the **variable on the left**.
 

ðŸ“Œ ```=``` is **not** equals
> Do not think of it in terms of math.
> ```python
> x = 3
> ```
> This is read as "x is assigned with 3."

  
- **Incrementing**: increasing a variable's value by 1; common operation used in loops or counters.
  - Example
      ```python
      x = 5
      x = x + 1
      ```
      - x is now 6

### 2. Identifiers

- **Identifier** aka **name**: the name given to variables, functions, or classes within code.
  - Names must follow these rules:
    - Must start with a letter or an underscore - not a number.
    - Can only include letters (**a-z, A-Z**), digits (**0-9**), and underscores ( **_** )
    - Cannot be the same as a Python **keyword**
  - Examples
  > Valid identifiers
  > ```python
  > first_name
  > _temp
  > street_address1
  > street_address2
  > state
  > zip_code
  > ```
  >
  > Invalid identifiers
  > ```python
  > 2name  # Starts with a digit
  > last-name  # Contains a hyphen
  > class  # Reserved word (keyword) in Python
  > ```

- **Reserved words** aka **keywords**: special words built into the Python language that hold specific meaning and purpose.
  - Cannot be used as variable or function names
  - Python 3 reserved words:
  > ```python
  > if
  > else
  > while
  > for
  > def
  > return
  > class
  > True
  > False
  > None
  > assert
  > as
  > async
  > await
  > except
  > import
  > pass
  > raise
  > in
  > is
  > return
  > try
  > lambda
  > nonlocal
  > with
  > yield
  > or
  > not
  > elif
  > del
  > continue
  > break
  > and
  > finally
  > for
  > from
  > global
  > ```
  > ðŸ“Œ Some of these keywords are valid identifiers if the first letter is either capitalized or lowercase. 

- **PEP 8**: Python Enhancement Proposal 8; the official style guide for writing clean, readable, and consistent Python code.
  - Includes best practices for:
    - Naming variables & functions
    - Spacing & indentation
    - Organizing code for readability
   


### 3. Objects

- **Object**: a container representing a value in a Python program; automatically created when you assign a value to a variable.
  - Example
  > ```python
  > x = 42 # Creates an integer object
  > name = "Oliver" # Creates a string object
  > ```
  >
  > ```42``` and ```"Oliver"``` are objects (the values)
  > ```x``` and ```name``` are identifiers that refer to those objects

- **Garbage collection**: an automatic process Python uses to delete objects no longer needed by the program; frees up memory space to keep the program efficient
- **Name binding**: the process of associating an identifier with an object in memory. When a value is assigned to a variable, Python binds the name to the object holding the value.
  - Example
  > ```python
  > age = 25
  > ```
  > - The name ```age``` is **bound** to the integer object ```25```
  > - If you write ```age = 30```, the name is **re-bound** to a new object (```30```)
  
- **Value**: the actual data stored in an object
- **Type**: tells you what kind of value an object holds, like an integer, string, list, etc. which determines what operations can be performed on the object.
- **Identity**: a unique identifier for each object in memory.
- **type() function**: a built-in function that returns the **type** of an object, showing what kind of data it holds.
- **Mutability**: describes whether an object's value can be changed after it's created.
  - **Mutable** objects **can** be changed (lists, dictionaries)
  - **Immutable** objects **cannot** be changed (integers, strings)
- **id() function**: a built-in function that returns the unique identity of an object in memory; guaranteed to be unique and constant for the object during its lifetime.
  - Example
  > ```python
  > a = 1000
  > b = 1000
  > print(id(a))
  > print(id(b))
  > ```
  > Note: two different objects with the same value will always have different identities.
  > Think of it like two people sharing the same birthday - even if they are twins, both individuals will have different SSNs.
  >   - There is one exception to this due to Python interning small integers (-5 to 256) to optimize memory usage & performance.


### 4. Numeric Types: Floating-point


### 5. Arithmetic expressions


### 6. Python expressions


### 7.  Division and modulo


### 8. Module basics


### 9. Math module

- **Module**: a separate file that contains code that you can reuse in your own programs.
- **Function**: a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. 
  - Example
    ```python
    import math

    print(math.sqrt(25)) # Outputs: 5.0
    ```

    - ```math``` is a module
    - ```sqrt()``` is a function within the ```math``` module
  
- **Function call**: when you activate a function by using a function's name followed by parentheses. Function calls tell Python to execute the code within the function.
- **Argument**: the value or data provided to a function when calling it. The function uses the argument to complete its task.
  - Example
    ```python
    print("Hello")
    ```

    - ```print()``` is the function call
    - ```"Hello"``` is the argument that is passed to the function

Math function examples

```python
import math

x = math.sqrt(25.0)
print(x)
```

  - Output: ```5.0```
    - The ```math.sqrt()``` function calculates the square root of a number.
    - Since the input is ```25.0``` (a float), the result is also a float.

```python
import math

x = math.fabs(3.1)
print(x)
```

  - Output: ```3.1```
    - The ```math.fabs()``` function returns the **absolute value** of a number.
    - It always returns a **positive float**.

```python
import math

x = math.pow(2.0, 5.0)
print(x)
```

- Output: ```32.0```
  - The ```math.pow()``` function raises the first number to the power of the second: 2<sup>5</sup> = 32.
  - Both inputs and the result are floats.

```python
import math

x = math.fabs(-10.0 + 5.0)
print(x)
```

  - Output: ```5.0```
    - The expression ```-10.0 + 5.0``` evaluates to ```-5.0```. and ```math.fabs()``` returns the absolute value: ```5.0```.

```python
import math

x = math.pow(5.0, math.sqrt(25.0))
print(x)
```

  - Output: ```3125.0```
    - The innermost expression ```math.sqrt(25.0)``` evaluates to ```5.0```.
    - Then ```math.pow(5.0, 5.0)``` calcuates 5<sup>5</sup> = ```3125```.
    - Both inputs and the result are floats.


ðŸ“Œ Exponents in Python

  > **Reminder**: In Python, ```^``` does **not** mean exponent (power).
  > Instead, it's the **bitwise XOR operator**.
  > To raise a number to a power, use ```**```.
  >
  > Incorrect
  > ```python
  >   x = 5 ^ 2 # Result is 7
  > ```
  >
  > Correct
  > ```python
  >   x = 5 ** 2 # Result is 25
  > ```




### 10. Random numbers

- **Random module**: part of the Python Standard Library, the ```random``` module provides tools for generating random values.
  - **random() function**: returns a random floating-point number between ```0.0``` (inclusive) and ```1.0``` (exclusive).
  - Example
  > ```python
  > import random
  >
  > # Store a random number in a variable
  > x = random.random()
  > print(x)
  >
  > # Print random numbers directly
  > print("Another random number:", random.random())
  > print("And another:", random.random())
  > ```

- **randrange(min, max)**: generates a random integer within a specified range; returns an integer between min (inclusive) and max (exclusive).
  - Example
  > ```python
  > import random
  >
  > # Returns a random integer from 1 (inclusive) up to 10 (exclusive)
  > num = random.randrange(1, 10)
  > print(num)
  >
  ># Returns random integers with 5 possible values
  > print(random.randrange(5))
  > print(random.randrange(5))
  > print(random.randrange(5))
  > print(random.randrange(5))
  > print(random.randrange(5))
  > ```
  
- **randint(min, max)**: returns a random integer between min (inclusive) and max (inclusive).
  - Example
  > ```python
  > # Returns a random integer between 23 and 50 inclusive
  > print(random.randint(23, 50))
  > ```

- **Psuedo-random**: numbers created by the ```random``` module aren't truly random, they simply **look** random, but they're calculated using a formula behind the scenes.
  - Python's random number generator works by:
  >  - Starting with a special value (**seed**), oftened based on the current time.
  >  - Using a formula to produce a sequence of random-looking numbers.
  >  - Each new number is bsed on the one coming before it.
  


### 11. Representing text

- **Unicode**:
- **Code point**: 

Common escape sequences

| Escape Sequence | Explanation      | Example code                                               | Output                   |
|:----------------|:-----------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------|
| \\              | Backslash (\)    | ```python print('\\home\\users\\')```                      | \home\users\             |
| \'              | Single quote (') | ```python print('Name: John O\'Donald'```                  | Name: John O'Donald      |
| \"              | Double quote (") | ```python print("He said, \"Hello friend!\"")```           | He said, "Hello friend!" |
| \n              | Newline          | ```python print('My name...\nIs John...')```               | My name...<br>Is John... |
| \t              | Tab (indent)     | ```python print('1. Back cookies\n\t1.1. Preheat oven')``` | 1. Bake cookies<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1 Preheat oven |

- **Raw string**: a special type of string where Python does **not** process escape sequences such as ```\n``` or ```\t```. To create a raw string, place an ```r``` before the opening quote: ```r'text'```.
  - Example
  > ```python
  > # Prints out the text exactly as it is within the single quote
  > print(r'This is a raw string\nIt will print the backslash and n literally')
  >
  > # Creates a string that be processed by the escape sequences, creating text on a new line (\n)
  > my_string = 'This is a \n \'normal\' string\n'
  > # Creates a string that will **not** be processed by the escape sequences,
  > # creating a string that is exactly as it is within the single quotes
  > raw_string = r'This is a \n \'raw\' string'
  >
  > print(my_string)
  > print(raw_string)
  > ```
  
- **ord() function**: takes a single character and returns its Unicode (integer) code.
  - Example
  > ```ord('A')``` returns ```65```
  > ```ord('b')``` returns ```98```
- **chr() function**: takes an integer Unicode point and returns the corresponding character as a string.
  - Example
  > ```chr(65)``` returns ```A```
  > ```chr(52)``` returns ```4```
