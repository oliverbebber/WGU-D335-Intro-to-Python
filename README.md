Welcome to my repository for the **Introduction to Programming in Python (D335)** course at **Western Governors University**! This repo includes **ungraded** code & exercises, as well as my personal notes as I learn the fundamentals of Python programming.


# ðŸ“š About the Course

This course covers the basics of Python, including

- Variables and Expressions
- Data Types
- Input and Output
- Loops
- Functions
- Conditionals
- Strings
- Lists and Dictionaries
- Simple problem-solving using Python


# ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Learn to write clean, readable Python code
- Build a solid foundation for more advanced topics and projects
- Share progress publicly as a portfolio of learning

# ðŸ§  What I'm Learning

I will update this repo regularly as I work through the course material. If you're also learning Python, feel free to fork, follow along, or reach out!

# ðŸ™Œ Acknowledgements

Thanks to Western Governors University and the D335 course instructors for the material and support. 

Additional thanks to the Python community for helpful tutorials!

# Helpful Resources

Within each lesson's notes I have linked references to helpful resources. However, since this class uses zyBooks and the lesson material / challenges don't operate like an IDE, I found it to be a little difficult trying to debug my code while in each lesson until I got to the labs sections. The following resource was a game changer for completing the course material and prepping for the exam. Hope it helps and good luck!
